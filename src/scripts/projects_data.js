      sujet: `EXT. PARK – DAY

Ivan and Richie are sitting on a bench. Ivan is well-dressed, with a sharp haircut — a solid man, a mix of Don Juan and Alain Delon. Richie looks like an ordinary workaholic. Ivan keeps smoking — he’s clearly nervous.

IVAN
Listen, this is business. How can I even tell you where to start?

RICHIE
You have to start somewhere.

IVAN
And what do people call you around here?

RICHIE
Richie.

IVAN
That’s funny somehow. Why “Richie”?

RICHIE
Let’s get to work.

IVAN
I picked up one woman. She was old, but still well-preserved — the wife of a very rich man.
We took a few pictures of her, you know, playing around. And you know women yourself...
In short, we trapped him. Tavo. What kind of man would do that?

RICHIE
No, I don’t agree with that.

IVAN
You’ve got enough experience from Chechnya and Abkhazia. One more blindfold, one less problem.

RICHIE
No. No.

IVAN
Fifty thousand.

RICHIE
Fifty thousand?

IVAN
Yes.

RICHIE
Well… for fifty thousand, I might think about it.

IVAN
That’s the deal — fifty thousand. She gives you the money, and you give me twenty-five for the tip.
Think fast — you’re not the only one with such experience.

RICHIE
Twenty-five percent of the amount?

IVAN
Twenty-five thousand. For my services.

RICHIE
No. Then do it yourself. I’m not playing.

IVAN
Okay, then how much will you give?

RICHIE
A few. You’ll have a widow soon — then there’ll be millions. Spend them with her.

EXT. BRUSSELS PARK – DAY

A lake with birds. On a bench sits THE WIFE — elegantly dressed, perfectly groomed, wearing an expensive greenish coat. She’s watching the birds.

Richie walks down the path, spots her, hesitates, then approaches and sits beside her.

RICHIE
Well, since you came, I guess you haven’t changed your mind.

Passers-by move along the path. The Wife looks at Richie, hands him a small note.

WIFE
No, rewrite it or memorize it — and give the paper back.

Richie searches for a pen. The Wife pulls one from her bag, hands him a cigarette pack to write on.

WIFE
He’s busy now. For two weeks he’s been staying up late with some important business.

Passers-by keep walking. One hides around the corner. Another appears.

RICHIE
Perfect place to be alone. No witnesses.

WIFE
Usually no one’s here on weekdays.

A group of noisy children runs by, laughing and pushing each other. The Wife finally dares — she places an envelope on Richie’s lap, quickly stands, and leaves. Richie lights another cigarette and walks away.


---

INT. CAFE – NIGHT

Richie sits at the bar. An empty glass beside him. He’s drunk. Loud music, crowded atmosphere.

The bartender gestures — another drink? Richie nods, pulls out cigarettes; several bills fall to the floor.

At a nearby table sit two girls: MARINA and VARVARA. Marina notices the money. Richie looks for it carelessly.

Marina quickly takes a sip, walks to the bar, bends down, and discreetly picks up three bills. She hides two and gives one to Richie.

MARINA
Don’t be so dramatic.

RICHIE
There must’ve been more... that fell.

MARINA
That’s all I saw.

She places the bill in front of Richie, showing her empty hands.

MARINA
You don’t think I took your money, do you? Want to search me?

Richie bends down to look under the stool. While he’s distracted, someone takes his seat.

He straightens up, sees the stranger sitting there.

RICHIE
Excuse me — that’s my seat.

The man starts to respond, but Marina pulls Richie’s hand.

MARINA
Don’t make a fuss. There’s room at our table. Come on.

She brings him to the table where Varvara is waiting.


---

INT. CAFE – LATER

Music. Laughter. Drinks. The girls chat with Richie.

Toilet area. A line of women waiting. Suddenly VARVARA pushes ahead, enters the restroom, and locks the door. Screams, banging, confusion.

Moments later, VARVARA emerges, calm, adjusting her hair. The others look shocked.


---

INT. CAFE – CONTINUOUS

A girl approaches the bartender.

GIRL 1
Where’s the manager?

BARTENDER
What’s wrong?

GIRL 1
A lady went into the restroom without waiting in line. She’s been in there too long. Maybe she’s sick. Open the door.
BARTENDER
Maybe she’s got diarrhea.

GIRL 1
It sounded like a bomb went off in there! I don’t know what she ate.

The bartender calls another staff member. They head to the restroom. A crowd of angry women gathers. The bartender knocks — no answer.`,

      sujet: `INT. CAFE – DAY

A cozy café. Few people. IVAN (the secretary) sits alone on a soft sofa, enjoying coffee and a slice of pie. He’s writing in a large notebook.

WAITER
Excuse me — would you like anything else?

Ivan is startled for a moment. He quickly shuts the notebook with his hand.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
No—no, just the bill, please.

The waiter leaves. Ivan reopens the notebook and hurriedly writes with his pen.

WAITER
You must be a writer.

The waiter places the check folder on the table, holding a portable payment terminal in his hand. Ivan pulls the folder closer and opens it.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
Yes. I expected it to be much more expensive.

WAITER
Off-season.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
I’m pleasantly surprised.

WAITER
Will you recommend our place to your friends?

IVAN (SECRETARY)
I promise.

WAITER
You really are a writer.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
No, not really. I just remembered a story. There aren’t many customers today — I’ll stay a bit longer.

WAITER
Only if you tell us your story.

They both laugh.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
It’s long.

WAITER
There’s no one here anyway.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
They’ll kick you out because of me… or rather because of my work story.

WAITER
Off-season. Unlikely anyone else will come today. I think you’re our last customer. I’m the owner. I’ll ask the staff to bring our signature pie — on the house. You start the story.

The waiter sits opposite Ivan and waves at a staff member.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
No, you can’t— I couldn’t accept that.

WAITER
I’ve been watching you for a while. I saw fear on your face, joy, and something else I couldn’t name. You felt those events deeply — you let everything pass through you.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
I’d never have thought that about myself.

WAITER
I once read that many great writers used to read their first works in salons before printing. The listeners gave feedback, then the writers revised and only later sent their work to famous authors or magazines for review. We can play the role of salon visitors — a young, unknown author reads his story. Maybe you’ll become famous. I’ll be proud that this table had your piece written on it. We’ll think about a little plaque — remind me when you sign your book before you send it to me.

INT. OFFICE – MORNING

An office. IVAN sits at a computer, busy. At another desk, MARK types away.

A phone rings. MARK answers.

MARK
Good day — Montblanc & Company office. How can I help you?

CALLER (SIDIY)
Good day. Can you tell me how much wheelchairs or crutches cost right now?

MARK
Sir, you have the wrong number. We don’t deal with crutches or wheelchairs.

CALLER (SIDIY)
You’re mistaken, boss — this is for him. Don’t spend money on lunch. We’ll eat at the boss’s memorial. While you have time, look for another job.

Mark hangs up, places the phone down, jumps up, quickly puts on his coat, rummages through a drawer and hurriedly shoves things into a bag.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
What’s going on?

MARK
I’m leaving. I can’t stand that Marcel — a crook. He deserves crutches.

He grabs his things and leaves the office. Ivan calls after him.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
What will you say if Marcel asks?

MARK (from the corridor)
Tell him I went to hell.

Mark shouts from the corridor as he exits.


---

INT. OFFICE – LATER

The office doors open. The BOSS and his WIFE enter.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
Good morning.

BOSS
Good morning.

BOSS’S WIFE
Good morning.

BOSS
Where’s Mark? He hasn’t been here. Didn’t call.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
He called. A man named SidiY.

The boss’s smile vanishes; fear and anxiety appear on his face.

BOSS’S WIFE
What did he say?

Ivan is embarrassed, lowers his eyes.

IVAN (SECRETARY)
He told me not to have lunch. Said don’t spend money… we’ll snack at your memorial.

(He falters.)
He said "your memorial."

BOSS
He said that?

IVAN (SECRETARY)
Yes, he did. Maybe we should call the police?

BOSS
No police. Don’t bother them over every rude man. They have enough work without us.

They enter the BOSS’s office, visibly shaken, and close the door. Arguments erupt from inside.
